Today Task_2 12 october 2021. While trying to push Task 2 files something went wrong that i have never encountered before and 
i tried to fix it by online help. Suddenly i noticed My first task files are gone ! Everything got cleared in origin master. Thats why I'm uploading Task_1 today

---# when i put this command git push -f origin master (Task 2 files successfully uploaded but previous files of Task1 got removed)
--# git push -u origin master (error: failed to push some refs to remote) then i tried <git push -f origin master> for task 1 (files successfully uploaded but previous files of Task 2 got removed!)
  

finally i come up push both task file by uploading to differnet  origin 
  --# Task 1 in master origin
  --# Task 2 in main origin
